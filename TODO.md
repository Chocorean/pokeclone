## Issues

- Despawn player entity properly when exiting the game (still relevant?)
- Need another set of States when InGame: walk, animation, fight, etc, need to be thought out precisely
- game crashes when starting a fight with an empty team. (which makes sense right now).

## TODO

- [Code] Too Much Logic in UI Widgets
- [Code] Style Ui widgets.
- [Code] Associate attacks with creatures on creation, not dynamically during fights.
- [Code] Fight (big)
- [Art] Animate all creatures sprites
- [Code/Bug] Cannot change level since neighbors not loaded yet
- [LDTK] Update layers zindex so the player shows correctly
- [Code] Leaving and re-entering the game messes up the sprite of the player.

### Rewrite the player entity

- [Code] NPCs directions
- [Code] Keep moving player when key stays pressed
- [Code] Player teleports on map instead of moving
- [Code] custom player position when entering a level (not always at the spawn loc)

## Done

- [LDTK] Add another level
- [Code] Link the two levels with a gate or something
- [LDTK] Add custom data to goals (level and coords dest)
- [Code] Read metadata from goals and update player accordingly
- [Code] Non-square player
- [Code/LDTK] Animate player
- [Code] Player directions
- [Code] WASM compatibility!
- [Code] Refactor attacks and all into the Dex
