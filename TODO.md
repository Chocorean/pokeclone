# Issues tracker

## Issues

- Despawn player entity properly when exiting the game
- Need another set of States when InGame: walk, animation, fight, etc, need to be thought out precisely

## TODO

- [Code] Fight (big)
- [Art] Animate all creatures sprites
- [Code/Bug] Cannot change level since neighbors not loaded yet
- [LDTK] Update layers zindex so the player shows correctly

### Rewrite the player entity

- [Code] NPCs directions
- [Code] Keep moving player when key stays pressed
- [Code] Player teleports on map instead of moving
- [Code] custom player position when entering a level (not always at the spawn loc)

## Done

- [LDTK] Add another level
- [Code] Link the two levels with a gate or something
- [LDTK] Add custom data to goals (level and coords dest)
- [Code] Read metadata from goals and update player accordingly
- [Code] Non-square player
- [Code/LDTK] Animate player
- [Code] Player directions
- [Code] WASM compatibility!
