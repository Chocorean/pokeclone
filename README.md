# A Pokemon-inspired first game

A pokemon inspired "game" - more like a prototype to be fair.

The main objective was to finish something that looks like a game, pratice Rust and discover ECS through Bevy.

The UI and style are disgusting, the way fights work is horrible, but it sets the ground to build something fun nonetheless.
