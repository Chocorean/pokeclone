The process of taming is through auras. The player will get assigned "an aura" at the beginning
after answering a few questions, like in a certain dungeon game. This aura will have different
categories: Aggressive, Gentle, Curious, Wise, Playful, Reckless. (WIP)

Each creature has its own aura. To tame a creature, a puzzle will have to be solved by the player.
Conditions will have to be met for the foe to be willing to be tamed.
The player will need an empty stone ring to tame the creature, up to five rings. The quality of the stone,
its type, and the ring itself will have influences over the process.
Imagine brass ring channels reckless personnalities better, so maybe you need one less condition to tame
a specific individual.
